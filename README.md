# Mapping Short-Term Rental Patterns and Housing Pressure Signals in Cape Town

## Problem Statement
Cape Town is experiencing rising housing costs, with certain neighborhoods becoming less affordable to long-term residents. One potential contributor is the growth of short-term rentals such as Airbnb, which can drive up local housing demand and prices. This project uses Airbnb listing data to identify neighborhoods with high price and density patterns that may signal **housing affordability pressure zones**.

## Research Questions
- Which neighborhoods have the highest Airbnb listing densities?
- How do average nightly prices vary across neighborhoods?
- Which areas combine high density and high price, indicating potential affordability pressure?
- What spatial patterns emerge in relation to the city center or coast?

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- GeoPandas / Folium for spatial analysis
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub for version control

## Timeline
10-day structured plan from scoping to publication.

## Expected Outcomes
- Map of affordability pressure zones
- Neighborhood ranking by Airbnb price and density
- Visualisation of how short-term rentals intersect with urban affordability
